In this weeks lesson we will be learning about:

* How to get started with Discord
* How coding club will work
* Version control
* Basic programming in C++

<!-- more -->

## Materials

- Zoom
- Discord and access to the Coding Club server
- Google Docs
- [Cplayground](https://cplayground.com/)

## Unplugged Activity 

To teach the kids about threading and version control, we will have them try to put a series of sentences in order first by themselves and then while others are also editing the same document. The goal of this activity is to illustrate the challenges of version control and the problem presented when more than one process needs to access or edit the same resource. 

We will then have the kids try to repeat the same activity, but this time only one of their group members is able to edit the document at a time to illustrate one solution to this problem (mutex).

## Coding Activity 

To introduce a new language, C++, we'll be using a tool called [cplayground](https://cplayground.com/) to show the kids several simple programs and then provide them with templates that they can fill in the blanks to complete. We will be showing them two methods of input and output, using the stdio library and using the iostream library. 

* `Hello World` Example: [iostream](https://cplayground.com/?p=armadillo-newt-sloth), [stdio](https://cplayground.com/?p=crocodile-wolf-dotterel)
* `Sum Two Numbers` Example: [iostream](https://cplayground.com/?p=quetzal-baboon-pelican), [stdio](https://cplayground.com/?p=herring-pelican-raven)
* `Find the Largest Number` Fill in the Blank: [iostream](https://cplayground.com/?p=fish-chough-panda), [stdio](https://cplayground.com/?p=pony-snake-zebra)
* `Print a Triangle` Fill in the Blank: [iostream](https://cplayground.com/?p=cormorant-hamster-ape), [stdio](https://cplayground.com/?p=ibis-siamang-fish)

We'll be there to help during the activities, but we'll also post solutions on the website for later reference.
