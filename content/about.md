# About Us

## What is coding club?  
Coding club is a place where you can learn about topics in computer science from computer science students from [Vancouver Island University](https://www.viu.ca/programs/science-and-technology/computer-science-bsc).

## What can you expect?
Every lesson will be made using the following structure:

### An [unplugged activity](https://csunplugged.org/en/)
In this portion of the lesson, we teach a topic in computer science without the use of technology. Some examples:

1. Binary numbers
2. Algorithms
3. Error detection
4. Turing machines

### Programming Activity 
In this section, we teach the basics of programming, which can then be used for projects like:

1. Creating a website
2. Animation
3. Game creation

### Live help
If a student would some help with a personal project or with the current lesson, there are several instructors who are ready to help. Some examples of things we can help with:

1. Javascript programming/game creation
2. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming
3. C++/Java programming
4. HTML and CSS (website creation)
5. Algorithms and data structures
6. And any computer science topic that a student may need help with. If we do not know the answer or how to help, we will research it and provide support in the following weeks' lesson.
