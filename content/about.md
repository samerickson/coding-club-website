# About Us

## What is coding club?  
Coding club is a place where you can learn topics in computer science from computer science students at [Vancouver Island University](https://www.viu.ca/programs/science-and-technology/computer-science-bsc).

## What can you expect?
Every lesson is will be made using the following structure:

1. An [unplugged activity](https://csunplugged.org/en/) where we cover a topic in computer science without the use of technology. Some examples:
    1. Binary numbers
    2. Algorithms
    3. Error detection
    4. Turing machines
2. Programming Activity where we teach the basics of programming, which can then be used for projects like:
    1. Creating a website
    2. Animation
    3. Game creation
3. Live help throughout entire lesson. If a student would some help with a personal project or with the current lesson, there are a number of instructors ready to help. Some examples of things we can help with:
    1. Javascript programming/game creation
    2. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming
    3. C++/Java programming
    4. HTML and CSS (website creation)
    5. Algorithms and data structures
    6. And any computer science topic that a student may need help with. If we do not know the answer or how to help, we will research it and provide support in the follwoing weeks lesson.
